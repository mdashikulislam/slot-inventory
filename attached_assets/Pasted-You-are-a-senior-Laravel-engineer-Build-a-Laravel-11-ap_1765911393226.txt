You are a senior Laravel engineer.

Build a Laravel 11 application for a SLOT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM with the following requirements.

TECH STACK:
- Laravel 11
- PHP 8.2+
- SQLite database
- Blade or Livewire for UI (no React)
- No Redis, no queues, no Horizon
- Must run on Replit using `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000`

CORE ENTITIES:

1) Phone
- phone_number (string, unique)
- email (string)
- provider (string, nullable)
- remark (text, nullable)

2) IP
- ip_address (string, unique)
- provider (string)
- remark (text, nullable)

3) Slot
- phone_id (FK → phones.id)
- ip_id (FK → ips.id)
- used_at (datetime)

RELATIONSHIPS:
- One phone can be used with multiple IPs
- One IP can be used with multiple phones
- Phone ↔ IP is many-to-many via Slot table

SLOT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Each phone can use MAX 4 slots within the LAST 15 DAYS (rolling window)
- Each IP can use MAX 4 slots within the LAST 15 DAYS
- A slot can ONLY be created if BOTH phone AND IP have available slots
- No fixed slot counter, slot usage must be calculated dynamically from time range

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

ADMIN FEATURES:
- Manually add / edit / delete Phones
- Manually add / edit / delete IPs
- Create Slot usage by selecting one Phone and one IP
- Block slot creation if phone or IP exceeds limit

DASHBOARD:
- Phone list showing:
  phone_number
  email
  provider
  used slots (last 15 days)
  remaining slots (4 - used)
- IP list showing:
  ip_address
  provider
  used slots (last 15 days)
  remaining slots (4 - used)

VALIDATION:
- Prevent duplicate phone numbers
- Prevent duplicate IP addresses
- Show clear error message when slot limit exceeded

DATABASE:
- Use Laravel migrations
- Use SQLite database
- Auto-create database file if missing

CODE QUALITY:
- Clean Eloquent models
- Proper relationships
- Controllers must be slim
- Business logic inside services or model methods
- Use Carbon for date calculations

DELIVERABLES:
- Migrations
- Models
- Controllers
- Routes (web.php)
- Blade views for CRUD + dashboard
- Slot creation logic with validation
- Ready to run on Replit

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT use seeders unless necessary
- Do NOT use auth unless asked
- Do NOT use API tokens
- Everything must work with fresh install
